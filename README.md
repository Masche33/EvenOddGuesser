# AI module guesser

## Goal:

To create a little ai, thatgiven a dataset <numer, number%secret> guesses the secret.

## Implementation:

### DataSet

It's the representation of a entire DataSet with a secret number. From it you can have the <numer, number%secret> tuple.

### EvenOddGuesser

The AI the throught ML and the DataSet learns the secret of the *dataset*.

## Results:

Given a lot of iteration the AI approximates the secret and can behave like the dataset.
